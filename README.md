MDAV(Maximum Distance to Average Vector) clustering implementation in java

Algo used in anonymisation to compute clusters for micro aggregation

1. Compute the average record of all records, find most distant record from average (xr)
2. Find most distant record xs from xr
3. Compute 2 clusters around xr and xs (closest points)
4. if there is more than 3k records, repeat 1.
5. if there is between 3k-1 2k records, compute average
5.1 find most distant xr from average
5.2 compute a cluster arround xr
6. remaining point are the last cluster
